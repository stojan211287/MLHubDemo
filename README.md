# A simple end-to-end ML playground

## Inspired by the [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) service

With this small service you can :

* Download datasets from the net
* Define feature transformations to mold raw data 
* Define Keras models to run on custom data and features

A demo of the service is available on [Heroku](http://mfh-demo.herokuapp.com) - NOTE: the service might take up to 30 seconds to spin up.

Upon following the link above, you will be taken to a login page; currently only a test user account is available. To access
MLHub use the following credentials :
